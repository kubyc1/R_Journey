# 🧠 R Programming Learning Journey

Welcome to my R programming journey! This repository documents the skills and concepts I've learned while studying R, with a strong focus on data analysis, data wrangling, and statistical programming using real-world scenarios.

### ✅ Core Concepts Covered

#### 🧮 Basics of R
- Variables and assignment (`<-`)
- Data types: numeric, character, logical
- Type coercion and type checking
- Arithmetic and comparison operators

#### 🔁 Programming Logic
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Logical operators (`&`, `|`, `!`)
- Looping with `for`, `while`

#### 🧰 Functions in R
- Built-in functions (e.g., `sum()`, `mean()`, `seq()`)
- Writing custom functions
- Function arguments and return values

#### 📊 Data Structures
- Vectors: creation, indexing, filtering
- Factors: categorical variables and levels
- Lists: mixed data types and nesting
- Matrices: 2D data structure manipulation
- Data Frames: tabular data, column operations, subsetting

#### 📂 Data Manipulation
- Subsetting with `[]`, `subset()`
- Filtering rows and selecting columns
- Adding and removing rows/columns

#### 📑 Reading and Writing Data
- CSV I/O with `read.csv()` and `write.csv()`
- Data inspection: `head()`, `str()`, `summary()`

#### 🧼 Data Cleaning & Wrangling *(in progress)*
- Handling missing values (`NA`)
- String manipulation
- Using packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr`
